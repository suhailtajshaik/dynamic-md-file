## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) (install via npm: `npm install -g pnpm`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### Usage
1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

3. Modify the src/Docs/example.md file and the App.js file to see changes in the rendered Markdown content.

### Markdown Structure
The example.md file supports the following placeholder syntax:

```
## {{MDENV_TITLE}}

# {{MDENV_DESCRIPTION}}

### This is code
{{MDENV_CODE_BLOCK}}


### This is JSON     
{{MDENV_JSON_SCHEMA}}

```

Where the values will be dynamically replaced from the `MDENV` object defined in `App.js`.

### Example MDENV Object
Hereâ€™s an example of how to define the `MDENV` object in your `App.js` file:

```JSON
const ENV = { 
  MDENV_TITLE: 'Hello World',
  MDENV_DESCRIPTION: 'This is a description.',
  MDENV_CODE_BLOCK: `{
    "example": "This is an example code block."
  }`,
  MDENV_JSON_SCHEMA: `{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "age": {
        "type": "integer"
      }
    }
  }`
};
```
